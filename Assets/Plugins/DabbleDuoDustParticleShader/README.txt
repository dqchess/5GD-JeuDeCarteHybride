Hello! Thanks for purchasing our Dust Particle Shader. If you run into any problems or have any questions, don’t hesitate to email us at emaildabbleduo@gmail.com

TO USE:
Simply find the DustParticles prefab under DustParticleShader/Prefabs/DustParticles and drag it into your scene. The DustParticles prefab consists of two particle systems: large circular dust particles, and smaller polygonally shaped particles. Feel free to modify these to your needs. We’re providing a couple dust shape textures which you can replace with your own.
